# Fist of Five --  SMS

An app that allows a user to elicit and receive feedback by SMS and visualize the results

Fist of Five-SMS fills a gap in exiting student feedback systems, being quick, confidential and effective. An instructor creates a poll, sends it to students on their mobile phones, they reply by SMS, and then instructor and class can see the tally. 

To teach effectively, instructors need to know what students do and don't understand. To learn effectively, students need to feel comfortable giving feedback about a course. 

Here at General Assembly we have some great tools to help with this, notably the no-tech "fist of five." When a teacher calls for "fist of five," students hold up their hands with 1-5 fingers to indicate how well they are understanding the material, with 5 being effectively complete comprehension. 

This can be modified as a "blind fist of five," which puts less peer pressure on students, but it also leaves students ignorant of how their fellow classmates are feeling. 

Fist of Five-SMS provides teachers with necessary feedback while maintaining students' confidentiality and giving them a sense of where they stand compared to their classmates.
